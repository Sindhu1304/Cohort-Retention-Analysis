# üìä Subscription Cohort & Retention Analysis

## üéØ Project Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze **user subscription behavior** using cohort and retention analysis techniques.  
It identifies **retention patterns**, **revenue performance**, and **churn behavior** across customer cohorts to improve **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** and reduce **churn rate**.

---

## üéØ Objective
This project performs an end-to-end **Subscription Cohort & Retention Analysis pipeline** ‚Äî from **data cleaning in Python** to **data modeling in Power BI** using **PostgreSQL** as the data source.

Key objectives include:
- Tracking subscription performance across cohorts and time.
- Measuring churn and retention rates.
- Analyzing revenue retention and customer lifetime.
- Building interactive dashboards for business decision-making.

## üîß Project Workflow

### **Phase 1 ‚Äî Data Preparation & Inspection (Python)**
**Dataset Source:** Maven Analytics ‚Äî Subscription Dataset  

**Columns:**
`customer_id`, `created_date`, `canceled_date`, `subscription_cost`, `subscription_interval`, `was_subscription_paid`

**Steps:**
- Cleaned and standardized data using **Pandas**.
- Created derived columns:
  - `active_status`
  - `subscription_duration`
  - `cohort_month`
  - `active_month`
  - `cohort_index`
- Calculated retention and churn metrics per cohort.
- Exported clean files:
  - `final_cleaned_subscriptions_user.csv`
  - `cohort_data.csv`
  - `retention_metrics.csv`

**Summary Stats:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Customers | 2,877 |
| Total Subscriptions | 3,069 |
| Active Customers | 1,065 |
| Churned Customers | 1,938 |
| Re-subscribers | 185 |
| Total Revenue | ‚Çπ1,14,504 |
| ARPU | ‚Çπ39.80 |
| Avg Subscription Duration | 84.84 days |
| Max Duration | 394 days |

### **Phase 2 ‚Äî SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)**

Cleaned data imported into PostgreSQL for cohort and retention analysis.

**Schema Tables:**
- `subscriptions_user`
- `cohort_data`
- `retention_metrics`

**Key SQL Queries:**
```sql
-- Active vs Canceled Users
SELECT active_status, COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM subscriptions_user
GROUP BY active_status;

-- Cohort Retention Summary
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_retention_summary AS
SELECT cohort_month,
       ROUND(AVG(retention_rate)*100, 2) AS avg_retention_percent,
       MAX(cohort_size) AS cohort_size
FROM retention_metrics
GROUP BY cohort_month
ORDER BY cohort_month;

-- Revenue by Cohort
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_revenue_by_cohort AS
SELECT cohort_month,
       SUM(subscription_cost) AS total_revenue,
       ROUND(AVG(subscription_cost), 2) AS avg_revenue_per_user,
       COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM subscriptions_user
GROUP BY cohort_month
ORDER BY cohort_month;
```

These SQL views were later connected to Power BI for dashboard building.

### **Phase 3 ‚Äî Data Modeling (Power BI Model View)**
Before visualization, data modeling was done to define proper relationships.

Model Components:

Fact Tables:

subscriptions_user

cohort_data

retention_metrics

SQL Views: v_revenue_by_cohort, v_retention_summary

Dimension Tables:

Cohort_Dim

Customer_Dim

Relationships:

One-to-many between Customer_Dim.customer_id ‚Üí subscription tables.

One-to-many between Cohort_Dim.cohort_month ‚Üí cohort tables.

Bi-directional filtering enabled for accurate monthly aggregation.
